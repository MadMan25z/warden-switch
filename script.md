# Warden Switch Script

*Opening shot??*

Today we will showcase a simple warden switch by MadMan25.  
This simple build is able to completely stop one player from summoning the warden.  

*Cut to top view of switch running with player off to the side standing on another shrieker, possibly jumping, opening chest, etc...*

Each player can only trigger a sculk shrieker every ten seconds.  
This device uses a player's arrow falling on an exactly 2.5 second interval to trigger the shrieker every 4 cycles  
So that the shrieker is triggered in the same tick that the player's cool down ends.  
When the arrow triggers the shrieker, the warden will attempt to spawn in an 11x13x11 area around the shrieker.

*Flash 11x11 area around shrieker rendered in game or overlay on video edit*

The warden is prevented from spawning by openings smaller than 3 blocks, blocks without a solid top hitbox, or fluids.  
An added bonus of using fluids is that fluids prevent spawns in caves below them.  
As long as this shrieker and arrow are loaded, and no wardens are in the area, the shrieker will trigger every 10 seconds  
This will prevent the owner of the arrow from spawning a warden elsewhere in the world.

[Material list]

*Cameral slowly fly over ancient city*

Before you get building, you'll need to find a naturally generated shrieker.

*Stop flyover and look down on a nice shrieker location*

To decrease the effort required to flood your spawn area, it is best to select a shrieker in the flattest area possible.

[Block by block tutorial]

*Show working chunk loader (dark's) next to working switch*

It's important to note that the switch must be loaded to continue working.<br>
This can be achieved by building in the spawn chunks,loading the area with the player<br>
or chunk loading with a portal loader like the one shown here (link in description)

*Show replay or 1st person footage looting and ancient city*

Remember that warden spawns are only prevented for the owner of the arrow.  
Each player requring warden protection needs their own switch  
Loot from each ancient city contains approximately 3-4 enchanted golden apples  
Happy looting!
