# Warden Switch Script

*Opening shot??*

Today we will showcase a simple warden switch by MadMan25.  
This simple build is able to completely stop one player from summoning the warden.  

*Cut to top view of switch running*

When the arrow triggers the shrieker, the warden will attempt to spawn in an 11x13x11 area around the shrieker.
The warden is prevented from spawning by blocks without a solid top hitbox, or fluids.  
Fluids also prevent spawns in caves below them.

[Material list]

*Camera slowly fly over ancient city*

Before you get building, you'll need to find a naturally generated shrieker.

*Stop flyover and look down on a nice shrieker location*

To decrease the effort required to flood your spawn area, it is best to select a shrieker in the flattest area possible.

[Block by block tutorial]

*Show working chunk loader (dark's) next to working switch*

It's important to note that the switch must be loaded to continue working.  
This can be achieved by building in the spawn chunks,loading the area with the player  
or chunk loading with a portal loader like the one shown here (link in description)

*black screen with short explaantion? or just blurred video of working switch*

Each player can only trigger a sculk shrieker every 10 seconds.  
This device uses a player's arrow falling to trigger the shrieker exactly every 10 seconds.  
This will prevent the owner of the arrow from spawning a warden anywhere in the world.  

*Show replay or 1st person footage looting and ancient city*

Remember that warden spawns are only prevented for the owner of the arrow.  
Each player requring warden protection needs their own switch  
Loot from each ancient city contains approximately 3-4 enchanted golden apples  
Happy looting!
